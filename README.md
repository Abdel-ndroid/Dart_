Learning Dart: From Basics to Intermediate

  Welcome to my Dart learning series! This repository contains a collection of
  exercises designed to take you from a complete beginner to an
  intermediate-level Dart programmer. The goal isn't just to solve problems, but
  to understand the "why" behind the code.

  This series is the basis for my educational content on TikTok and GitHub.
  Follow along as we build our skills together!

  How to Learn from This Series

   1. Solve Sequentially: The exercises are designed to build on each other.
      Start with Part 1 and move through the tasks in order.
   2. Understand, Don't Copy: Try to solve each task on your own first. If you
      get stuck, look at the solution, but then take the time to understand why
      it works.
   3. Experiment: Change the code! What happens if you use a different data
      type? What error do you get if you remove a keyword? Breaking and fixing
      code is one of the best ways to learn.
   4. Read the Docs: When a new concept is introduced, take a moment to look up
      the official Dart documentation for it. This will deepen your
      understanding.

  Part 1: The Foundations (Exercises 1-5)

  This first branch focuses on the absolute fundamentals of the Dart language.
  The goal is to get you comfortable with the basic syntax and building blocks
  of any program. By the end of this part, you will have a solid grasp of
  writing simple scripts and functions.

  Topics Covered:

   * Variable Declaration: Using String, int, double, and bool.
   * Basic Output: Printing to the console.
   * Functions: Creating reusable blocks of code.
   * Parameters: Understanding the difference between required, positional,
     named, and optional parameters.
   * Combining Concepts: Putting variables and functions together to perform a
     simple calculation.

  Part 2: Building Real-World Skills (Exercises 6-25)

  This second branch moves beyond the basics into the concepts you will use
  every day as a Dart developer. These exercises are designed to teach you how
  to structure your code, manage data, and handle complex operations gracefully.
  Mastering this section is the key to building robust and efficient
  applications.

  Topics Covered:

   * Control Flow: Making decisions with if/else and switch, and repeating
     actions with for and while loops.
   * Collections: Storing and manipulating groups of data using List, Set, and
     Map, including powerful methods like .where() and .map().
   * Null Safety: Learning Dart's modern and safe approach to handling null
     values.
   * Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The core of modern app development.
     You'll learn about classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, abstract
     classes, and mixins.
   * Asynchronous Programming: Using Future, async, and await to handle
     time-consuming operations like network requests without freezing your app.
   * Error Handling: Managing exceptions with try-catch blocks to make your code
     more resilient.
